# cra-template-fwnd-router

This [cra-template-fwnd-router](https://github.com/fwnanodev/cra-template-fwnd-router) js template is based off [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that has react-router-dom v6 setup already and is mainly used for our Azure static web app creation script.

You can manually download it and use it by specifying:\
`npx create-react-app my-custom-template-project --template file:path/to/cra-template-fwnd-router`
